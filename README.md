## Trigonometry
![Image of Title](title.JPG)
Trigonometry (from Greek trigōnon, "triangle" and metron, "measure") is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships between side lengths and angles of triangles. The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies.
There are six trigonometric ratios, sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant and cotangent. These six trigonometric ratios are abbreviated as sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot. These are referred to as ratios since they can be expressed in terms of the sides of a right-angled triangle for a specific angle θ.
Basic Formulas
There are basically 6 ratios used for finding the elements in Trigonometry. They are called trigonometric functions. The six trigonometric functions are sine, cosine, secant, co-secant, tangent and co-tangent.

By using a right-angled triangle as a reference, the trigonometric functions or identities are derived:

sin θ = Opposite Side/Hypotenuse
cos θ = Adjacent Side/Hypotenuse
tan θ = Opposite Side/Adjacent Side
sec θ = Hypotenuse/Adjacent Side
cosec θ = Hypotenuse/Opposite Side
cot θ = Adjacent Side/Opposite Side

Reciprocal Identities
The Reciprocal Identities are given as:

cosec θ = 1/sin θ
sec θ = 1/cos θ
cot θ = 1/tan θ
sin θ = 1/cosec θ
cos θ = 1/sec θ
tan θ = 1/cot θ
All these are taken from a right angled triangle. With the height and base side of the right triangle given, we can find out the sine, cosine, tangent, secant, cosecant, and cotangent values using trigonometric formulas. The reciprocal trigonometric identities are also derived by using the trigonometric functions.
